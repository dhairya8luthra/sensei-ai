Programs exist in Business (MBA, MS in Management), Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering and more.<br>- upGrad assists with credit transfer, university application, and even student visa guidance, making the transition smooth. The online part is co-designed by the partner university to ensure curriculum continuity. On-campus, students join the cohort of that university and finish their degree, graduating with the university’s diploma (same as a regular student).<br>- **Benefits:** Significant cost reduction (the online year is much cheaper than on-campus fees). Students also have extra time to prepare for living abroad (IELTS/TOEFL, cultural prep) during their online study. It mitigates risk – if someone cannot go abroad due to unforeseen reasons, they still have a PG certificate for the online portion.<br>- Popular destinations: Programs with UK (e.g., University of Essex, Liverpool John Moores), Australia (Deakin University, James Cook University), USA (Case Western Reserve University for certain STEM masters) are available. E.g., a Study Abroad MBA might have 6 months online with a top Indian institute and 12 months at PSB Paris or Deakin, resulting in a dual/global MBA:contentReference[oaicite:195]{index=195}:contentReference[oaicite:196]{index=196}.<br>- Students get the best of both worlds – an Indian cost structure for part of the degree and an international degree and campus experience. Many have leveraged this to land global jobs or to settle abroad after education. It's a growing trend for smart globalization of one’s education.<br>- **Support:** upGrad provides end-to-end counseling – helping choose the right program/university based on student profile and career goals, and robust support while abroad. Alumni testify that this pathway gave them confidence and global outlook while being cost-conscious.",":contentReference[oaicite:197]{index=197}"
